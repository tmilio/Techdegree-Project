# Techdegree Project 1
 My first techdegree project 
 A python program to create a random number guessing game
 The program creates a new random number between 1 and 10 every time the user plays and asks them to guess the number 
 Once guessed the user is asked to play again, then shown the high score if they choose to continue playing
